# Resume Evaluation and Grading System 🤖📄

The Resume Evaluation and Grading System is an AI-powered web application designed to analyze resumes intelligently and provide structured feedback, grading, and improvement suggestions. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to evaluate resumes based on skills, content quality, and relevance.

This project aims to help students, job seekers, and recruiters by automating the resume screening process and making resume evaluation faster, smarter, and more consistent.
